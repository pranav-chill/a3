Yeah I would say that  However with that aside Terry Brooks H AS managed to inject as much originality into a series that has been ongoing since 1977 as is possible  As usual I still find myself as eager now for his next novel as I was in High School waiting for The  Wishsong to come out  I am as many are looking forward to a break from Shannara to see what else is bouncing around in his ingeniously creative mind  I have hear LOTS of rumors but after interviewing him  for myself I think that I will keep some of it quiet to allow the surprise to be that much bigger  enjoyableBack to the book though  Straken has a wonderful finality to it which was lacking with the end  of Morgawr a few years back  The whole idea of being trapped INSIDE the Forbidding is easily one of  not THE most creative aspect of almost all the Shannara stories since perhaps when Brooks introduced us  to it originally back with Elfstones  Knowing what to do  then being ABLE to pull it off are never quite the same with any novel set in the world of Shannara  As is also the case with Straken  Pen Ohmsfo rd in his attempts to help rescue his aunt the former Ilse Witch banned to the Forbidding by the use of dark magic runs into many MANY roadblocks along the waythe least of which includes evil menions of t he false Ard Rhys trying to capture  kill himwatching friends die finding love  Once Pen secures what he needs in order to help his aunt he runs into you guessed it: even more problems  That's okay  Never  fear the outcome is never really in doubt  The journey to find the resolution to this particular problem isn't just fun but for me it seemed more loaded with action  fantasy-charged testosterone than I h ave read from Brooks in a long time  We get to see what a SEAL team would be like Shannara-style  it was a real high point in the entire series  You can definitely see additional depth to the writing skil ls of Mr Brooks  fantastic character development as he continues his love of penning great storiesOne last thought: I am a le-long fan of Terry Brooks  He has earned my loyalty by writing great stuff agai n  again  Moreover after meeting him personally he is easily the most down-to-earth kind  thoughtful author I have ever met  At a book signing it doesn't matter HOW many people are in line behind you he t reats each person as though they are the ONLY person there  doesn't put a limit to how many questions you can askeven  it means he'll be there into the wee hours  He certainly hasn't forgotten where he ca me from  WHY he is successful in the first place: his READERS  You can say what you want about the guy but I will ALWAYS be first in line to buy his books just as long as he continues to write them  He al ways makes me feel as though my money was well spent when it comes down to it isn't that all that matters?it was a real high point in the entire series  You can definitely see additional depth to the writ ing skills of Mr Brooks  fantastic character development as he continues his love of penning great stories    One last thought: I am a le-long fan of Terry Brooks  He has earned my loyalty by writing grea t stuff again  again  Moreover after meeting him personally he is easily the most down-to-earth kind  thoughtful author I have ever met  At a book signing it doesn't matter HOW many people are in line beh ind you he treats each person as though they are the ONLY person there  doesn't put a limit to how many questions you can askeven  it means he'll be there into the wee hours  He certainly hasn't forgotten  where he came from  WHY he is successful in the first place: his READERS  You can say what you want about the guy but I will ALWAYS be first in line to buy his books just as long as he continues to write  them  He always makes me feel as though my money was well spent when it comes down to it isn't that all that matters?  2005-10-12
